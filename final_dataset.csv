*(Pick Poughkeepsie Area- Monthly summarized data- 2000-2022, Precipitation, Sum and press go)*

You'll see that July and August are set to be record low rainfall since 2000, and although if we keep breaking low records it would be very bad- you can see what a little tropical moisture can do to the numbers... check out a few of those max numbers in Sept, Oct, and Nov.

And even if we break the 2001 year total low record- check out all the numbers since 2000...

In the HV we are lucky that multi and contiguous years of record low rainfall are very rare.

Now that's not to say we should go out and use water like crazy- conservation is warranted- always and very much so right now IMHO.  I also understand climate change will continually affect weather patterns and like stocks- past performance does not indicate future results necessarily...

BUT for those getting seriously anxious, don't panic.  Look at the climatology data linked above, and I think it will make you feel better.

For me it was university and getting an education which helped realize just how ahistorical/wrong/cherry picked the claims of the right wing ""intelligentsia"" was. Like they would say shit about Islam or Muslims (which would more often than not be wrong or taken out of context) then not even mention things like colonialism, the CIA overthrowing half their governments or the little fact that America being a biiiig supporter of all the groups they claim to hate. I'm guessing that's one of the reasons they hate ""woke education in universities""/ 

They talk about how horrible feminism is but fail to mention the things it's actually done like give women, aka half the worlds population, more rights than ever which has allowed many societies to prosper. They want to actively go against that but also shit on countries like Saudi Arabia for preaching the same thing but praise Russia which is arguably way worse when it comes to the treatment of women. I kept asking myself why until I realized the obvious answer, it's a white country and everything they say is engrained with racist undertones meant to make who they deem as ""lesser"" or ""savages"" look as bad as possible based strictly on their skin color. 

Which is funny because for people who preach about ""Western civilization"" and ""Western values"", they sure do seem to hate both of those things and want to take back to a non-existent past. Like how far back do they want to go because a lot of what they preach goes against ""Western values"" even of the past and more I thought about it, the more I realized they would have to passed the enlightenment, passed Rome and even passed Greece to get to their ""perfect world"". 

And it really goes on and on, them denying climate change was also a big one, but I think the biggest thing was just how massive cry babies they all are and how they managed to convince people it's actually the left because of how well they stick together. Like all they do is whine and bitch and moan about cancel culture, the ""woke left"", cringe LGBTQ+ people/content online, Muslims, black people, Socialism etc. They don't actually have any platforms or ideas except being against what ever is actively moving people forward and cutting taxes on the rich, who just happens to fund them.

Yes, these places aren't that great right now, but once climate change gets worse, they will get better.

* we are only recycling about 10% of water, if we can do more it would make a big difference

comment,imlc7mr,2sjw0,socialdemocracy,FALSE,1661989846,https://old.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/x2p2fe/opinion_of_joe_biden/imlc7mr/,"I posted this on a somewhat similar question on the r/seculartalk subreddit about ranking Biden should he have recently retired:

I've been reading a book where the author gives a rundown of the major crises and events each president has faced and how they responded to said crises. After giving the rundown he gives them either a standard letter grade or an incomplete because the guy died in office early on. I've only recently got to Lincoln, but I think Biden easily ranks in the top 15 presidents. The US has had 45 presidents and a lot of them have been pretty fucking bad.

Skip to section three if you only care about what I have to say about Biden.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The bottom rung is filled with guys like John Tyler, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Herbert Hoover, Richard Nixon, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump all rank at the bottom for me. Those kinds of guys were either breathtakingly incompetent or criminals or both. Tyler probably belongs in the next rung, but the guy literally got elected to the Confederate Congress during the Civil War. Things are still up in the air about Trump, but Tyler literally became a traitor to the country he once led. On that, alone, he deserves being in the bottom rung.

The next rung features guys like Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan. These are the guys who I think either failed to rise to the challenges of their day or actively worked to, in my eyes, make things worse. Many of them were, in my eyes, the weak and feckless Presidents who were either unable or unwilling to even attempt to change the toxic status quos of their day. Or, in the case of Ford (since I haven't read up on his presidency, yet), they preemptively pardoned that piece of shit Nixon.

After that is the rung featuring guys like John Adams, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, Ulysses S. Grant (may deserve placement on a higher rung), William McKinley, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. I'd say these guys were giants of their age, but also did a lot of things that I am strongly critical of. Do I think they were all bad like the guys below them, though? Not in particular.

The next rung is occupied by guys like John Quincy Adams, William Howard Taft, John F. Kennedy, and Jimmy Carter. I'd say they were guys who probably had good intentions, but ultimately had relatively inconsequential presidencies for whatever reason. I'd probably put most of the post-Reconstruction and pre-1899 presidents here, but that stems more from my relative lack of knowledge about them than from anything they may or may not have done while they were in charge. Kennedy is a bit of an exception here. Major things happened while he was President and he made big decisions, but I also tend to think he is overrated as a president. He's probably better than the guys I listed, but not nearly good enough to qualify for the next rung. Adams II may be ranked unreasonably high, but I strongly admire his post-presidency political career.

After that is the rung of actual good presidents. Presidents who actually had a good vision even if I don't always agree with that vision or their tactics. They actually accomplished good things while in office. I'm still critical of them, but I think they weigh in firmly on the positive side. This is filled with guys like Thomas Jefferson (I waffle on him), James Madison, Woodrow Wilson, Harry S Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Barack Obama.

The final and highest rung are those presidents who, in my eyes, qualify as Great Men of History (Politician Edition)^(TM). All joking aside, these are the greatest presidents in my mind. Even if they did some or many disagreeable things, I think the good things they did greatly overshadow them. In chronological order, these Great Presidents^(TM) would be George Washington (borderline), Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt (may be a bit overrated, but he's easily my favorite President), and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (I consider FDR to be the best President).

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for Joe Biden, I think he's done a lot of good stuff in his first year-and-a-half in office given the political constraints he faces. Domestic policy highlights for me include the stimulus checks, the American Rescue Plan and the vaccine rollout, changes he made to the USPS, forgiving some student loan debt (all in my case) and continuously delaying loan repayment, the infrastructure bill, the CHIPS Act, the PACT Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.

Foreign policy highlights for me include withdrawing completely from Afghanistan, supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia, reengaging with the Iranians in regard to the nuclear deal, overseeing a massive drop in drone strikes in foreign conflict zones, and rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement.

Of course, there are many aspects of his presidency that I am critical of. However, I've found that those criticisms are mostly because I want him to do more of what he's already done rather than for him to just do something even microscopically good. It's like the difference between upgrading from one slice of pizza to two slices and not getting any pizza at all.

I think, for me, when honestly rating his presidency, it's important to get over the fact that Biden isn't Bernie. If you're waiting for Biden to, for example, cancel all student loan debt then I think you're purposefully setting yourself up for failure, disappointment, and maybe even anger. I can understand wanting it, but I also think it was ridiculous to even put that card in your deck of potential new policies and laws. A lot of stuff like that is likely never going to happen. Especially with how Congress looks right now and with what kind of politician Biden is.

As far as ranking him, I think, with what he's done so far, Biden is already equal to or slightly better than Obama and that those two have been the best presidents since Lyndon Johnson and Harry Truman. Hopefully, he keeps the train going.",0.9969,5

Mixed economies are a result of capitalists of the past being forced to compromise with socialists. Socialism is why we don't have the *really* bad capitalism anymore.

Like, 100% socialism isn't the only socialism. In fact, almost no socialism is like that, even in countries that claim to be socialist.

Socialism is like democracy. Nowhere on Earth has 100% infinity democracy. But most places on Earth have some democracy, and almost everywhere democracy is, it improves things over not having democracy, and most places where there could be more democracy, it would make things better so long as it's implemented well. The result is that democracy is one of very, *very* few things that have improved the quality of life of humanity without being a physical technology.

Socialism by ending the *really* bad capitalism, has already proven itself to be at that tier of value to civilization. But capitalism, hate to tell you - still pretty bad!

Presently, capitalism is on track to burn down the planet and exterminate the human species via extreme climate change brought about by the actions of rich people who will be dead before then, and so do not care.

Capitalism can *not* stop doing that, because *capitalism is what is doing that*, because capitalism is why those rich people have the power to make those decisions. Right now, we need to stop the still-bad capitalism, and that will take *way* more socialism implemented in *way* more places, until rich people no longer have the power to choose to burn down the planet and exterminate humanity to make their line go up.",0.7841,36

If you already don't deeply desire kids, this is possible. A lot of people want to be parents and experience that. It's easier to give up meat than give up the desire of parenting, IMHO.

I agree!

&gt;As long as folks are thinking about it and making some positive choices, then they are doing their part.

This is where I disagree. Because that *some positive* is very vague. There has to be a threshold if we have to make any kind of dent into the problem of climate change we are facing. It's very easy to think that you are contributing even when the reality is different.

&gt;
&gt;That means, for instance, that Norwegian runways, Seattle streets and London bridges handle wind, rain and cold just fine, but a triple-digit heat wave? Not so much.
&gt;
&gt;This project illustrates some of what can happen when unprecedented heat settles over a built environment that isn’t ready for it. Each of these things has happened somewhere, or in many places, around the world, but we’re putting them all in one fictitious town.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;Our fictional friends in Meltsville had just one weather crisis to handle, with no water shortage, no wildfires, no storms.
&gt;
&gt;But out in the real world, an extreme heat wave is often part of a catastrophic spiral. It may exacerbate drought that parches foliage, which fuels wildfires, which leave barren land susceptible to flooding. Infrastructure that ices over in January may become waterlogged in April and bake in July.
&gt;
&gt;“There’s a concept in engineering called stationarity, the assumption that your assumptions don’t change,” said Millar, a former transportation engineer and planner. “With climate change, those assumptions are changing.”

This looked like a pretty interesting exercise to go through, and would potentially be useful for actual cities to work through with some modelling. What are some of the consequences for various likely scenarios to each community, and what might be some ways to mitigate the worst of them?

The Earth can’t even handle the current population getting a decent standard of living RIGHT NOW. It would take [1.1 Earths to give the global population in 2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33133712 ) (about 7 billion people at the time, it’s over 8 billion now and counting) the same living standard as the average person in China in 2012, accounting for resource consumption, land use, carbon emissions, etc. According to the cofounder of the organization that provided the data for the graphic, this is a SIGNIFICANT UNDERESTIMATE since “there are aspects on which no good data exists that we don't include, so our demand on nature is larger” as he stated in the article.


For context, [the average Chinese person made just a bit over $5.50 a day when the infographic was made](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-in-poverty-relative-to-different-poverty-thresholds?country=~CHN ) AFTER adjusting for price differences between countries. That’s about $2000 per year.


***The Earth CANNOT handle a population of 7 billion people living a lifestyle where they make just over $2000/year, adjusted for price differences between countries.*** This standard of living is FAR below what any housed person in a developed country could endure, nevermind enjoy life in, no matter how hard you try to make it sustainable. There is no way to provide a pleasurable existence for the 8 billion people alive now, never mind the 10 billion or more projected to exist by 2100. It will only get worse as developing countries industrialize and consume more resources per capita as populations boom and resources (many of which are nonrenewable) dwindle, especially with climate change dramatically exacerbating things. The only moral solution is lower birth rates unless you want a global genocide, eternal poverty for most of the planet ([as is happening now](https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2018-10-17/world-bank-half-the-world-lives-on-less-than-550-a-day )), or mass famine.


Then there are the horrific effects of climate change and resulting flooding, resource depletion, natural disasters, wars, immigration crises, etc. [The climate crisis could displace 1.2 billion people by 2050](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/09/climate-crisis-could-displace-12bn-people-by-2050-report-warns ) and [its effects on the environment, water supply, and agriculture are already causing shortages](https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/here-s-the-latest-data-on-climate-and-food-and-it-s-not-good/ar-AAYSNv7?ocid=msedgntp&amp;cvid=75cc860818c4436bbe8b895074b9aa7a ) even though we aren’t even close to the expected temperature increase or reaching net-zero emission targets yet (if ever). The second article also states that “some experts predict the earth will run out of topsoil within six decades.” If you thought the right wing backlash to the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis or Mexican immigration to the US that gave a global resurgence of the far right was bad, you haven’t seen anything yet. Not to mention, political crises and wars like the Arab Spring and the rise of terrorist organizations were [exacerbated by rising food prices and water shortages caused by climate change](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-and-rising-food-prices-heightened-arab-spring/ ).


But let’s say this is wrong and the planet can handle 11 billion or more people. Even then, there are still only a finite amount of resources available.

The difference is that in the past machines replaced human physical labour and pushed humans to leverage their mental intelligence to justify their labour value instead. Now artificial intelligence replaces human mental intelligence. What do humans have to leverage next?

The main point is that artificial intelligence is a fundamentally unique type of automation.

But often people fall into the fallacy of believing that ""human society always eventually advances in a positive direction"" is an unfallable law of nature based on an insignificant 100k year record which biases them towards over-valuing historical trends and prevents them from correctly appraising new things.

Similar reason for why people have difficulty recognizing how human intervention can drive climate change and mass extinction of millions of species. It is difficult to recognize how advancement enables human actions to negatively impact the environment on a planetary scale.

Any scientist that intentionally publishes misleading information will destroy their entire career. The fact is that regardless of the results of any scientific research, there will be plenty of science left to do. 

If we suddenly discovered that covid vaccines were unsafe (which they aren't), it's not like everyone would lose their jobs - in fact they'd have more work to do, and would receive even more funding to develop a vaccine that is safe. If they found that covid vaccines are perfectly safe (which they are), then there would still be more work to do developing future vaccines to be more effective, especially against newer variants.

Essentially, the likelihood of a donation influencing the results of scientific research, and not having that be found out pretty quickly is exceptionally low.

It'll definitely have to wait until my kid is out of the house (a few years yet), but I could be down for this then.

But the truth is: What can we do? Even if we were to stop all carbon emissions tomorrow, we're still screwed. Thwaites is about to uncork a bunch of ice. The permafrost is thawing, releasing tons of methane. The disappearing ice is going to leave darker surfaces to absorb more heat. Which is to say, we're entering a massive positive feedback cycle that will be technologically, beyond our abilities to stop. At this point, I don't think we can feasibly stop it from happening. The genie is out of the bottle.  We'll have to ride it out until all those positive feedback sources run out of fuel. That'll be several decades at least. The methane will break down in 8 years or so, but it breaks down into CO2 and H2O, so that's not fantastic either.

The equipment to do it could be purchased for less than the cost of a house and really, having worked in university labs, old equipment can end up in storage and people forget about it. Virologist takes the old stuff home and nobody notices.

If you're asking ""why would someone do that?"" Stephen Paddock, David Koresh, Jim Jones, Francisco Gonzales, David Burke, Devin Kelly, James Holmes... Do they need a reason?",0.8583,1

Which isn't true, but that's another issue.

Science is about what can be proven because it can be measured and predicted. If it can't be predicted and measured, it's not science.

And see, I remember the predictions about people having to move to Antarctica because it was going to be too hot at the equator. I remember how snow was going to be a thing of the past. I remember how the global temperature was supposed to rise between 3º to 9º by 2025. I remember how most species were supposed to perish by 1995. I remember how the Great Barrier Reef was supposed to die.

Historically, about half the time science is about finding things that don't fit conventional wisdom. That has been true since at least the ancient Greeks. 

My best information is that anthropogenic climate change is wrong and we need to focus on things we can fix.",-0.7862,1

comment,iml80mu,2s6ky,longdistance,FALSE,1661988002,https://old.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/x2pspc/moving_in/iml80mu/,"Before you approach moving in, I always think it's important to consider what the end goal is, and there's lots of important conversations to have. 

**Finances:** talk about them and agree to a plan. Joint account or no joint account? 50-50 or slightly different percentages, depending on who is making more at the time? Keep in mind that at different points in the relationship, the financial balance will shift. You may earn more for a time and then your SO might earn more for a time. The real important thing here is that you and your SO are able to adapt to the changes together (this is not just for finances, but for the marriage as a whole and your lives together).

**Division of Household Labor:** self-explanatory.

**Family Expectations:** Of course, this is about whether you want kids or not and also HOW to raise them. But this is also about managing your individual families. Got a toxic family member on your side? It's your responsibility to put them in their place, put up boundaries, defend your spouse. Got a toxic in-law? Your SO better be doing the same things.

**Life/Career Goals:** Obviously, be supportive and be honest. You're going to talk to each other about this stuff and goals will sometimes change as circumstances change. And you are going to have your individual goals, mostly for career. Create a relationship and marriage where you both feel like you have the freedom to pursue your individual goals too, not just the shared ones.

**Friendships:** Similar to Life/Career Goals. You will have shared mutual friends and then your individual friends. Once again, make sure there's a balance. Yes the majority of your time will be spent together. But for a truly healthy relationship and marriage, you need to create time and space to allow yourselves to grow as individuals. This means spending time with your friends, sometimes without your SO. So long as there's nothing shady and you trust each other, there isn't nothing to worry about. If you're unsure about a specific friend because of something communicate with your SO about your feelings.

**Therapy/Marriage Counseling:** Be open to these things IF things ever get really bad in the marriage. Let your SO know before marriage that you are open to these options and ask if they are too. We cannot predict the future. Relationships and marriages go sour for all kinds of reasons and it can happen to anyone. If your SO knows that you are at least open to therapy and marriage counseling as a last resort if things ever get THAT bad, then it really establishes a certain level of trust.

**Health/Food/Exercise:** Make sure you both take your health seriously, physical and mental. You obviously care about each other, but your individual health is your responsibility. How you guys do it is really up to you. If you like exercising together, that's fine. If it's better for you guys to exercise individually, that's fine too. Just as long as you both are taking care of yourself. For mental health, seek therapy when possible.

**Social Issues and Politics:** While it may seem self explanatory, a lot of people don't always know where their partners stand on hot button issues. If you two had a kid that came out as gay or trans or anywhere else on the LGBT2SQ+ spectrum, how would that be handled? How do you two want to discuss things like systemic racism? How do you both feel about the climate crisis? etc.

**End of Life and Medical Decisions:** This probably feels like a very far off thing but understanding each other's needs and wants when it comes to quality of life is important. You two will have medical power of attorney over the other and knowing what your partner wants and does not want is critical.

**Now you might be thinking: ""Coastal, these are huge topics, we're just moving in together"" and you're right but all too often people progress relationships to moving in without thinking about some of the bigger picture things. It's better to discuss this stuff now when you're in an international LDR rather than when you're local and in a tricky situation.**

Otherwise, my standard copy and paste advice is as follows:

Whether you’ve lived with a partner before or not, there’s lots of important questions to ask when you’re closing the distance and having someone move to you, or moving to them. 

Here are a few things to consider when you’re broaching the subject 

T**he Biggest One:** 

Who is moving, what does the visa/moving process look like, and what financials do you need to make this work.

Let’s be real, logistics aren’t sexy, but they’re what will make this dream come true. It’s important to ask these questions to work through who it makes the most sense to move. 

**Some Other Logistical Questions:**

* Timeline: what is a realistic timeline to make this happen, what obligations need to be met prior to closing the distance

* Living situation: are you moving in together or living separate for a while? Are you finding a new apartment all together or staying in your SO's old place? 

* Finances: how do you plan to split bills, cost of the visas or moving costs etc. Is this a financially viable time to move?

After you’ve explored the facts, it’s time to have some tough conversations about what could happen during the process of closing the distance and after. Consider having some of these bigger picture conversations. 

* What happens if your significant other is failing to thrive in their new ""home""? (Can't find a job, struggling to make friends, is generally homesick and miserable, etc.) It’s not something anyone really wants to think about but it is a reality. It’s wise to contemplate what you would do before you get down the rabbit hole and realize that you’re stuck. 

* What is your vague relationship timeline/goals? Do you want kids in the next year or two? A house? Make sure you're on the same page with what should be joined goals.

* Are you both willing to make some sacrifices? If it's better for your SO to live in a big city rather than your hometown due to career or schooling opportunities, are you willing to try moving there? Sometimes closing the distance doesn’t always mean exactly where you or they currently are, moving to a third city is sometimes the most beneficial and rarely something couples contemplate.

* What are your realistic expectations for living together? When you’re visiting your SO, you’re likely not experiencing their real every day life and you won't be in vacation mode, so what does a normal M-F look like to the two of you? And do your individual lifestyles compliment or clash with each other?",0.9991,8

It isn't necessarily what your opinions are or how you ""come across"" it is what you can get PASSED.  I don't know that any other candidates could have gotten the things passed that Biden did.  Bernie Sanders may hold opinions closer to many on this subreddit including myself, but that doesn't mean if Bernie has been in Biden's place he would gotten any of these things passed much less anything to the left of Biden which I guarantee what have been shot down (free college, UBI, etc.). This is what made someone like President Johnson in the U.S. in the 1960's such a badass.  He was EFFECTIVE. He could sell ice water to people in the Arctic as it were.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, I don't think a lot of younger people can appreciate the big deal that bargaining for prescription drug prices is. I've watch bills for this come up to Congress since the 1990's and ALWAYS get handily defeated.  And we're talking getting downvotes by DEMOCRATS as well as Republicans.  Prescription drugs are about 10% of total health care costs so this is a BIG DEAL.  An although the climate change legislation obviously doesn't go as far as many of us would want it's remarkable he was able to get it passed with a Senate evenly split.",0.9857,44

So, we have a comment composed of assertions of unidentified types of fallacies without providing argumentation or support for these assertions. If we must use youtube skeptic bro language, this is itself an informal fallacy, called [proof by assertion fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_assertion)
Calling something you dont like a fallacy doesnt automatically make it so, you need to substantiate it.
Next we have several really overt strawmen of my position, so let me first clear those.

**Strawman 1;**

&gt;dictatorships and mass executions

I do not advocate dictatorships, nor do i advocate ""mass executions of government members"". I am not a bolshevik. You are gonna have to step up your game and argue against my actual position, if we want to have a genuine discussion.
Make sure to argument however, why we should sit and hardcore oppose action putside of electoralism, wasting now more than 40 years on a fantasy, when the systemic violence that goes on due to that inaction outweighs even the more visible revolutionary violence.
And just as a reminder, make sure to not strawman me so absurdly this time.

**Strawman 2;**

&gt;Theres not going to be a global socialist revolution in the next 10 years -&gt; strawmanning me as anti-reform

You are again arguing against a strawman. Even my comment above very clearly states i support reforms. I dont _only_ support (minor) reforms, as I also do not oppose revolution, but again, i definitely support reforms through electoralism.  So i just so happen to advocate additional action outside electoralism, especially building mutual aid community networks, the only safety mechanism able to withstand the shocks of climate change. That type of action is even extremely peaceful :).

The third paragraph is so hilariously absurd that i had to read it twice to make sure i wasnt missing a point there somewhere.

Given that you are for some reason mentioning lightbulbs, lets take them as an example. 
So tell me, where do these ""swedish lightbulbs"" (?? lol) actually come from. Who extracted the rare earth elements for the electronics portion of the bulb for example? Spoiler: not swedes, rather slave kids in third world nations. And, where do these electronics go (dangerous waste) once used up? is it perhaps sent to Southeast asia to be picked apart by, again, slaves, wearing no protection and being chronically poisoned?

Advice to ""just ride slowly"" does absolutely nothing lol since in this climate we start sweating immediately after stepping outside the house. This will be slightly harder if you're an undergrad and thus don't have dedicated office space like I did to store stuff, but here were the crucial things for me that made bike commutes tolerable during the hell period of May to late November:

* **Bring a change of underwear** \-- this is relatively easy since it's small and you can just stuff it into your backpack. (You specified F, so I'd recommend commuting in a sports bra if that's your thing and also changing that once you arrive.) Most days I didn't bring a whole change of clothes, not even a new shirt. It's amazing how far simply dry underwear will go to making you much more comfortable throughout the day.
* **Quick sink bath** \-- as soon as you arrive on campus and lock up your bike, find a good restroom where you can run your wrists under the cold tap for a minute (this really helps you stop sweating faster, unless the ""cold"" tap is lukewarm in the summer like in LA, which is super annoying), and then get some damp paper towels and wipe down your sweatiest parts before changing clothes (see previous point). The key here is to try to start the cooling down/stop sweating process asap because otherwise sponging off with paper towels won't do any good.
* **Bring deodorant** \-- since you don't have an office, just keep a travel deodorant in your backpack.
* Stay in a building with good A/C for a while, until you thoroughly cool down. YMMV depending on your class schedule, of course. In grad school there was a coffee shop on the edge of campus that I'd go to early in the morning to work for a while, then ride/walk my bike to the office later.",0.9778,11

Hopefully that never happens. 

Regardless, to narrow down my point, it’s no secret that police and the military are largely made up of conservative minded people.

Year by year you can have pretty drastic differences, but it's the long-term trend you have to look at. But 100 years from now, I don't think you're going to find many humans on this planet, if you find any... We're very rapidly approaching a point where a virologist with the motivation and modest means can produce a handful of deadly, contagious viruses and wipe out most of mankind. This isn't crazy talk. You can order DNA on the internet. You can buy the equipment to manufacture viruses for less than the cost of a house. We have complete genomes (publicly available info) for thousands of viruses.

Some might ask, ""why would someone do that?"" I'd say, ""Ask Stephen Paddock, Jim Jones, David Koresh, and Jin Ruchao, among others."" You can't tell me Stephen Paddock wouldn't have wiped out mankind given the opportunity. So it's not a matter of IF it will happen. It's simply a matter of when a virologist gets angry enough.

And if by some chance that just doesn't happen (maybe civilization collapses first), then we're screwed in a number of other ways. Every day there are stories about how climate change is worse than they originally predicted. Today from Scientific American, ""This Hot Summer Is One of the Coolest of the Rest of Our Lives"" An article on CBS today about lakes in the Arctic disappearing, ""Scientists long expected that Arctic lakes would expand with climate change as ground ice continued to melt and climate models showed that drying would not be seen until at least 2060 or 2150."" Oops, guess they botched that prediction pretty badly. All the glaciers are disappearing way faster than they ever predicted. Nobody predicted the massive methane emissions from thawing permafrost, and thawing permafrost wasn't anything we were expecting to see in the 2000s, if you asked 20 years ago.

A lot of people find this really depressing. I mean, I've done a good bit of research in this and I don't really see a silver lining. Our best case scenario is that there will be a massive loss of life and maybe some people will survive long-term, but I think it's unlikely. I'm way past the emotional side of this. Until someone can show me something super-promising, I see this as more or less, a fact waiting to happen.

Did I mention the plummeting fertility rates for men? Between 1930 and 1992, sperm counts in men in America dropped about 50%. They continue to fall and those rates are now dropping worldwide. Within a few decades, most men will be effectively infertile. So you tag that on to all the other stuff going wrong and it's going to be hard to survive.",0.4383,1

If collectively most of the world's carbon was from of solar and hydro construction, we'd be in a much much different world.  
  
Not every place is fortunate to have vast hydro resources like Canada and especially Quebec.  With climate change and droughts, and water rights being huge contentious points, hydro dams looking less feasible in many parts of the world.  
  
The research is showing that solar panels re-coup their carbon emissions within months to 3 years.  As the world wide grid becomes more carbon free, so too will the manufacture of solar panels.  Solar panels (and renewables in general) solve their own carbon emissions problem.  Also, with the ample rooftop and parking lot area of a typical solar factory, wouldn't they start installing solar panels onto their own roofs?  Their CO₂ emissions would go down significantly by using the very product the factory makes!  
  
25 years is only the warranty period of most solar panels and 25 years is a long time indeed.  Even then, the panels will still have some 80% of their original power capacity available.  

Solar farms are the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of all energy sources with wind a close second depending on its on- or off-shore wind.

Solar farms may actually never die either.  They can ""rejuvenate"" themselves by incrementally and partially replacing old panels with newer generation panels even as the farm is still running.   Other power plants like hydro, coal, gas, nuclear need near complete or total dismantle &amp; rebuild.  Both processes require skilled workers and machinery.  Solar farms can be built mostly by most any able-bodied person off the streets with minimal training and gear.  Everything is on the ground too.

Older aged solar panels can be donated or sold to less demanding applications.  Consider 80% capacity remaining on a **free** or much reduced-cost panel is better than 0% which you'd get with no panels.  Solar panels are incredibly robust being sealed solid-state semiconductor components.  They may never actually reach 0% functionality.

The video was relating to rooftop solar.  It needs to be said that only solar is able to so seamlessly blend into the urban landscape.  Solar operates completely silently with no moving parts.  Solar panels provide the most efficient use of energy as every watt generated locally is a watt not stressing a distant power plant or the grid to transmit that watt.  Only solar does this.  Residential and commercial solar actually ""unloads"" the grid.    
  
Persistent strong heat waves are making the news these days all over the world.  It needs to also be said that solar works extremely well in heat waves as heatwaves come with abundant sunshine.  The local energy grid experiences some of it's maximum stress levels during heatwaves and residential &amp; commercial solar helps unload the grid at this critical time.

Pervasive residential/commercial solar also helps build a more *distributed* grid architecture versus the traditional monolithic *centralized* grid architecture.  Distributed systems are far more resilient than centralized ones.  Distributed systems are tough to take down completely.",0.9852,1

Well thought out response and good info to know.  I prefer deep diving on the subtleties of something rather than just blindly accepting the entirety of an ideology. At the very least i want to look at this issue as something more than EV GOOD, ICE BAD. 

&gt;but I would argue that climate change is the most immediate threat to the environment, and because of that and the difficulty of quantitatively comparing the impact of different chemicals, it makes sense to treat greenhouse gas emissions as the primary variable to minimize.

My only response to this, is that if that is the case, then the first thing that should be on the agenda for environmentalist types is becoming Vegan. I'm not a Vegan myself, but it's clear that the carbon footprint of factory farming is not sustainable. It goes far beyond what passenger ICE cars ever did. We cannot provide meat for everyone in the world to have every single day. It is not good for the planet. You don't just get to buy a flashy new 80,000$ EV and show off your cool car and then stop there. If these people truly want to ""minimize carbon footprint"" eating meat should be the first step before the car you drive. That is if we are going in the order of priority of what's most detrimental like you mentioned. In my eyes, a vegan in an ice car is more environmentally conscious than some rich dude who bought a tesla. 

The only way to get the world to stop eating meat or reduce meat consumption is to legislate it, so long as it's legal and people want it, they will do what it takes to get it.  and good luck changing that. They're trying with fake artificial meat, but i predict that to be a failure that needs more years of research and technology before it ever takes off. Some sources cite animal agriculture responsible for over 80% of global greenhouse gasses. That' IN SANE. that HAS to be exaggerated.

No, we don't. When we are talking about ""the rise in carbon levels,"" we're not talking about soot dust blowing in the air. We're talking about **carbon dioxide**. That's usually between .04 and .05 percent of the atmosphere. As in 4 parts per ten thousand.

Water vapor is the most abundant and most active greenhouse gas. The level of water vapor varies. 20% humidity is about 400 times as much as the average CO2 readings, and humidity is not a global constant.

We can replicate all of water vapor's known effects in the laboratory. But when it comes to the ""carbon cascade effect"" where just a little more C02 radically changes the behavior of the atmosphere, it's never been shown or replicated in the lab. **It's a computer projection,** a massive fudge factor that can't be accounted for in nature.

Speaking of 50 years, there have been at least two spans in that period when the climate change predictions have failed for years, **including right now.**

Even a few degrees difference can have massive effects on the planet and it’s inhabitants.

The fact that different parts of the world are getting record lows and record highs in daily temperatures is one of those effects. It’s why they stopped calling it global warming… because a level of ignorance of the scope of what a warming planet entails was confusing people when they were getting record lows. Climate change, while not as detail related but still accurate to describe the issue, was easier for people to understand in name. 

Global warming/climate change is 100% a real thing. Denial of that is pretty stupid at this point, and I believe the government’s foux salutations have only exacerbated the issue of acceptance from people. It’s important to recognize that global climate change is a natural thing too, but unfortunately humans are vastly impacting the rate at which this thing is happening.

We probably won't even need to continue to pave over our desert lands with solar panels and turbines in order to satiate a demand of almost 50,000 MW during the summer. By the way, California's peak power demand was in July 2006. Our consumption has yet to reach the same level of demand in over 16 years. Even with the proliferation of EVs, self-generating homes will probably offset a lot of what we would otherwise see as demand, at least for the next few years.

Diablo Canyon supplies us with 2,256MW (+/- 10MW) of power every day, and has done so without issues for decades. Right now, DC is running at 100% of its nameplate capacity, and has been running between 99.8 and 100.3% of its rating all day, and will do so again tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after tomorrow. Nuclear power is clean, consistent, and cheap (fuel costs in 2014 were 6 cents a KWh). If you care about the environment, you would support keeping it online.

&gt;California’s planet-warming emissions rose by 2% after the San Onofre generating station in San Diego County malfunctioned, eventually leading to its permanent closure. That wasn’t the only reason emissions rose, but it was almost certainly a factor.  
&gt;  
&gt;Similarly, the share of New York state’s electricity coming from natural gas, a fossil fuel, rose by 4 percentage points after one of two reactors at the Indian Point nuclear plant closed last year. The other reactor produced its final electrons last month.  
&gt;  
&gt;It doesn’t have to be that way, and Diablo Canyon was supposed to be a model of how to retire a nuclear plant without worsening the climate crisis. But critics say Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Public Utilities Commission is failing in that mission.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Diablo’s retirement is going to increase greenhouse gas emissions. And their planning is not doing anything to prevent that,” said Mark Specht, an energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “We should have figured this out by now.”

[Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Verde_Nuclear_Generating_Station) is a nuclear power plant located in Arizona, but Californian entities own 27% of the power plant, and so of the 3900MW it produces, we get around 1000MW a day. You'll find that we never drop below 1000MW in imports in the [CA ISO supply tab](https://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/supply.html). Now you know why.

Which is worse? Civil war or abject tyranny at the hands of an authoritarian government? When Trump was President people defended the political violence of the BLM riots because that was righteous struggle against an evil oppressor. Are Democrats incapable of oppressing those they see as a threat to them?

&gt;Will it be external? No, we have nuclear weapons.

That's a little naive. Our enemies can whittle away at our ability to influence the outside world without provoking a nuclear response. cyber attacks and economic warfare and invasion of our discourse with propaganda can't be repelled with nukes.

&gt;The real crisis scenarios are climate change economic collapse, and natural disasters.

The larger threat of economic collapse comes from people simply not wanting to work jobs to support the economy anymore. Climate change isn't causing that, unless you count the irrational fear of climate change causing millions of young people to become hopeless and nihilistic for no good fucking reason.

&gt;Ground-based combat in the United States will only be civil. I don’t want these militia guys taking point of a crisis. They immediately become the biggest threat to other civilians.

Maybe, but during the parade shooting in Dallas where 5 cops were gunned down by a BLM supporter. there was a group of about 50 of those militia guys armed with AR's, and yet there wasn't a single instance of friendly fire between the militia guys and the police because the militia guys followed all of the rules you are supposed to follow during an active shooter scenario.

So where are all of these people accidentally shooting each other's faces off? I'm sure you can point to a few idiots out there, but it seems to me like you're advancing a stereotype to justify your general disdain for everyone who holds a conservative opinion on 2A.

&gt;Absolutely not. There isn’t a single Republican in my state who has lifted a finger on climate change. And until the Republican Party starts to develop a positive effort, the only solution is for them to stay out of public life — to remain in private life, where they can’t do any harm.

&gt;It doesn’t matter what sort of bland statements that they issue saying, “Oh yeah, I know climate’s a problem.” It’s how they vote. There are no votes, zero votes. There’s no votes in the Senate for climate action from the Republican Party. Zero. So they need to remain in private life. We need to do everything we can to ensure that until they change their stripes, and there’s no sign of that at the moment.

&gt;I hate to say that. It’s painful to say that because here you have this national catastrophe and you only have one party working. Until that changes, we need to elect Democrats. It’s the only game in town.

Personal transportation is responsible for a very small part of global carbon emissions and environment impact in general, and 2. An actual comparison of the environmental impact of ICEs and EVs is difficult to quantify. 

I'll address point 2 only. Yes, you are absolutely right that it is difficult! Lithium/cobalt waste is not the same as carbon dioxide emissions is not the same as NOx is not the same as diesel particulate. There are thousands of different chemicals that affect the environment in different ways. The EPA uses ""CO2 Equivalent"" emissions to compare energy use and chemicals that act as greenhouse gases relative to how much a certain amount of energy or a certain mass of a chemical affects the earth's mean temperature. You can find the EPA's calculator here: https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator

I don't know the science behind this CO2 equivalent calculation, but when we talk about comparing lifetime emissions of ICEs and EVs (a comparison which most apples-to-apples studies agree EVs win, but the amount by which they win varies widely), this is the metric that is usually used. Things like lithium waste from batteries and iron waste from engine blocks are not addressed by the calculator since they are not greenhouse gases. Similarly with non-fuel fluids like oil and coolant. All this is to say that I understand and agree that all of these chemicals have an important impact on the environment, but I would argue that climate change is the most immediate threat to the environment, and because of that and the difficulty of quantitatively comparing the impact of different chemicals, it makes sense to treat greenhouse gas  emissions as the primary variable to minimize. That's why we talk about carbon taxes, carbon emissions, etc. in any conversation about environmental preservation. I will also say that for all the chemicals I mentioned--lithium, iron/steel, and some consumable fluids used in an ICE--there are ways to recycle them to minimize buildup in the environment.

In summary, yes, it is hugely difficult to accurately quantify ""total environmental impact"" and as far as I know no such metric has been developed yet. However, ""CO2 equivalent emissions"" is a well-thought-out alternative metric, and is currently the best option we have for any ""environmental friendliness"" metric used in any comparison at all.",0.968,3

Anyone who's dependent on gas to heat or produce warm water is fairly fucked. These often are people who were unable to renovate to make their homes more efficient or people who rent. So financial lower- to lower middle class.
Or (and here it gets a bit interesting) people who did indeed recently renovate and used the (illogical) government support to rip out their old oil heating and convert to gas.They often were financially strained already from the high costs of renovations and are now pretty fucked, although I must admit I don't have that much compassion for them as it was basically known to everybody that this is a short sighted idea in terms of climate change alone.(TBF everyone I know who did so is a climate change denier and ""green-hater"" and did it at least a bit to ""rub it in Greta's face""..).
But in the end private households will be supplied at least in a reasonable manner (unless we something drastic like sabotage on infrastructure,etc.),but for a lot of people it might be too expensive -unless the government for once keeps the promise made today for a huge ""social energy net"" for lower incomes.

The other side is electrical power.And that is just a collective fraud on the market by the way our electricity wholesale prices work. 
Basically the most expensive mode of production dictates the prices - once meant to give renewables an advantage over conventional production it has long turned around and supported conventional production - now gas. 
We only produce something like 10-12% of our power demands with gas and this is normally more meant as a reserve capacity but due to the Frenchies having the real energy crisis (almost half of their nuclear powerplants are off the grid due to age, not enough cooling water or maintenance - and France is creating most it's energy supply with them,including heat) these plants are currently used 24/7.

Yes, there were heroic acts and great ideas, but ultimately fealty to the dead and their ideas and their way of doing things is undeserved or worse.

What this means is that the future is unwritten.  We owe them nothing, as future generations should owe us nothing.  The future really begins when we stop forgiving the sins of the past, stop saying things like ""you have to understand the times,"" and judge harshly, so that we ourselves, and our descendants, do better: so that we do not expect charity from future generations and so get on with the business of fixing this misery, knowing we will, at least in terms of our legacy, be held accountable.

One of many examples is we have failed to constrain climate change.  We have, in the process of doing this, blamed everyone but ourselves (Americans, that is), the biggest carbon emitters in the world.  We complain limply, we blame industry, and then we buy what industry sells, keeping them afloat and yet we place exclusive blame on systems and institutions to absolve us from any responsibility to alter our own behavior.  We look for reasons to divide ourselves, to make coalition-building impossible. 

We focus on the [wake of the boat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oswx23Tz-_w) which only marks what happens in the past; the wake need not have anything to do with the future.  The wake points to the past.  And the ship can turn if people just want it to turn, and make the effort to start steering.

This atrocity is just one of countless examples of why we should stop trying to resuscitate the past.  It is not salvageable.  I wonder sometimes if people just lack the courage to face an uncertain future, wrench the boat in the new direction, and take the risk.

These photographs of this repulsive human ""zoo"" is our inheritance from these shitheads.  What will the future inherit from us?

We have seen the legislature appropriately respond when it comes to things like reproductive health, gun control, early education investment, and public transit. There are a couple of areas I would point to as deficiencies.   


Civic &amp; Voting. This year the legislature should be applauded for modernizing our elections by making mail-in voting permanent and expanding early voting. However, they missed an opportunity to increase participation in our democracy by not joining nearly 20 other states + Washington DC including same-day voter registration into the legislation. Same-day voter registration is a viable strategy for increasing participation in our elections, especially amongst BIPOC communities and younger voters. 

  
Educator Workforce. I lead the educator diversity coalition in my day job as the advocacy director at Latinos for Education.. We filed landmark legislation this year to help us diversify the educator workforce and help address the teacher shortages in the profession. While the legislator made some great budgetary investments that our coalition pushed for ($25 million for scholarships + education debt payment &amp; programs to recruit/retain educators), they missed an incredible opportunity to provide more statewide support to districts by passing our bill. This legislation would have provided increased flexibility on licensure, more uniformity around diversification +retention+ hiring + training, additional funding for growing your own pipelines and gave educators a seat at the decision-making table to help solve workforce challenges moving forward. We are now seeing across our Commonwealth that many communities, including Salem, will be dealing with teacher and staffing shortages. This bill was too important not to make it to the finish line.   
  
For my part, here’s what I would do differently. First, I plan to integrate myself as a legislator into the types of statewide coalitions that I have led so that we can co-create solutions to the challenges we face across public education. Climate change, public transit, housing, and civic engagement. Second, I would have strongly opposed the approach of prioritizing sports betting over more pressing legislation that was held up like the Economic Development Bill, and the Educator Diversity Act.   
  
The legislature consistently runs out of time at the end of the formal session on 31st. I would like to see the body revisit the informal session altogether. In February of the 2nd year of the session, we run into joint rule 10 (the reporting deadline for bills) and then the legislature only gives itself 5 months to consider all the bills that get discharged favorably while navigating the budget and conference committees. My understanding is that this was a change that came about 30 years ago when members of a “Good government” group didn’t want lame ducks and folks who lost their races to pass legislation. While I understand this may have had its merits, it's very clear that too many good priorities are left on the table.",0.9907,5

I think we're dealing with tiers of insulation from climate change here, though the reasons why some places in the same general risk tier will be more livable will vary (ie the Great Lakes region has fresh water but has other issues). 

Also we need to look at geological and climatic regions, not state boundaries. The great lakes is a region; the parts of MI and MN that are far from them might as well be Ohio or Iowa climatically speaking. 

That said I think we know some areas that *are* going to be deeply difficult to persist in- the desert Southwest (water), the Southeast (flooding, hurricanes, and extreme heat/humidity wet bulb), and the non-great-lakes Midwest (drought, fires, heat, cold, tornadoes and extreme storms).

I'm sorry. It isn't my intention to be unkind.

But there's a balance between idealist/positive thinking and realistic thinking. 

By that, in this case, I mean that the reality of the situation is that these well out of control changes to the environment are a much, much bigger problem for humankind to work around than (for example) the industrial revolution and its effect on the average person, the average city, and the average nation way back around the turn of the *last* century. That challenge was a paper cut in comparison to the sword-through-the-belly that the challenge of surviving and adapting to climate change is and will be for the foreseeable future. 

Part of the problem (which the pandemic illustrated in no uncertain terms) is that the world being more connected was the main reason why supply lines crashed. The ways in which the wealthy investor class has changed our global economy in the interest of profit wound up being one of the things most affected by a pandemic. And nothing is being done to moderate that at all... and the next pandemic will almost certainly be worse. I'm not saying to expect it next year or even in your lifetime. But sooner or later, it will happen with some catastrophic results *unless some things about how commerce works are changed in a manner conscious of the simple fact that another pandemic will come*. 

That's just a tiny piece of it, but it is there. 

On the topic of disease: as localized weather becomes more extreme (as it is happening now), migrant patterns for animals are changing. This raises the likelihood of pathogens taking hold in places where they couldn't before. In the same package, there are seriously overpopulated places (Bangladesh is the ur-example) which exist in exactly the worst possible places to be as weather changes happen and the oceans begin to rise. This will result in multiple climate refugee crises across the civilized world. Right here in the states, the southwest will be a difficult place to live in relatively short order. And how many people live in or far too near to the mouth of the Mississippi? ""New Orleans is sinking"" isn't just a great song by The Tragically Hip. Right now, all over the world right around 40% of the global population lives within 100km of an ocean coast. A little more than 3 billion individuals. The ocean doesn't have rise much at all to render hundreds of coastal cities entirely unlivable. Some will just be under water. Miami has been having major issues with high-tide flooding for more than a decade now... and that's just the beginning. 

I'm just getting started and my reply is already in TL;DR territory. 

You're right: We WILL find new ways to get water. Right now desalinization technology is being refined and improved. That is very likely the best possible solution to the arising water needs. And crops are constantly being engineered for better survivability, faster growth, higher yields. There are limits to this, of course, but the bigger problem is in how our various cultures react to the knowledge that crops are being engineered. Right now an entirely bullshit ""organization"" gets paid to do nothing more than to *authorize* products as being non-GMO. There's tags from the Non-GMO Project on thousands of food items, and 99% of them have never been genetically modified (in a lab)... but Domino sugar still pays for, and passes along the cost to consumers, a tag so the consumer (who can't be bothered to do **actual** research) will feel ""safe"". People will have to be damn close to starvation before they'll finally eat golden rice for two reasons: the media makes its money on keeping people afraid and GMO's became boogeymen to do exactly that, and various and sundry celebrities and politicians with little-to-no critical thinking skills keep speaking loudly on the topic. 

Its alright to place your bets in line with history... the track record is there. But this isn't like any challenge we as a species have met before... it is much larger by far, and too many people are so bound up in ideology to even consider making changes to help.",-0.8048,2

It's a useful grab-bag for talking about issues like law reform and workplace discrimination, but less so as you dive into addressing people's stated needs.  Literally 95% of my congregation voted for marriage equality a couple of years ago, and we were active in the push for the ordination of people in same gender relationships.

Meanwhile there's been significant pushback on the church council's idea to include our preferred pronouns in our written communications as a matter of course, so I'll be spending this afternoon trying to begin a pathway to a respectful conversation between those who think the move is a no-brainer and those who think it's a no-brainer that gender is fixed and requires no discussion.

[https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=aly](https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=aly)

*(Pick Poughkeepsie Area- Monthly summarized data- 2000-2022, Precipitation, Sum and press go)*

You'll see that July and August are set to be record low rainfall since 2000, and although if we keep breaking low records it would be very bad- you can see what a little tropical moisture can do to the numbers... check out a few of those max numbers in Sept, Oct, and Nov.

And even if we break the 2001 year total low record- check out all the numbers since 2000...

In the HV we are lucky that multi and contiguous years of record low rainfall are very rare.

Now that's not to say we should go out and use water like crazy- conservation is warranted- always and very much so right now IMHO.  I also understand climate change will continually affect weather patterns and like stocks- past performance does not indicate future results necessarily...

BUT for those getting seriously anxious, don't panic.  Look at the climatology data linked above, and I think it will make you feel better.

I've been reading a book where the author gives a rundown of the major crises and events each president has faced and how they responded to said crises. After giving the rundown he gives them either a standard letter grade or an incomplete because the guy died in office early on. I've only recently got to Lincoln, but I think Biden easily ranks in the top 15 presidents. The US has had 45 presidents and a lot of them have been pretty fucking bad.

Skip to section three if you only care about what I have to say about Biden.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The bottom rung is filled with guys like John Tyler, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Herbert Hoover, Richard Nixon, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump all rank at the bottom for me. Those kinds of guys were either breathtakingly incompetent or criminals or both. Tyler probably belongs in the next rung, but the guy literally got elected to the Confederate Congress during the Civil War. Things are still up in the air about Trump, but Tyler literally became a traitor to the country he once led. On that, alone, he deserves being in the bottom rung.

The next rung features guys like Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan. These are the guys who I think either failed to rise to the challenges of their day or actively worked to, in my eyes, make things worse. Many of them were, in my eyes, the weak and feckless Presidents who were either unable or unwilling to even attempt to change the toxic status quos of their day. Or, in the case of Ford (since I haven't read up on his presidency, yet), they preemptively pardoned that piece of shit Nixon.

After that is the rung featuring guys like John Adams, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, Ulysses S. Grant (may deserve placement on a higher rung), William McKinley, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. I'd say these guys were giants of their age, but also did a lot of things that I am strongly critical of. Do I think they were all bad like the guys below them, though? Not in particular.

The next rung is occupied by guys like John Quincy Adams, William Howard Taft, John F. Kennedy, and Jimmy Carter. I'd say they were guys who probably had good intentions, but ultimately had relatively inconsequential presidencies for whatever reason. I'd probably put most of the post-Reconstruction and pre-1899 presidents here, but that stems more from my relative lack of knowledge about them than from anything they may or may not have done while they were in charge. Kennedy is a bit of an exception here. Major things happened while he was President and he made big decisions, but I also tend to think he is overrated as a president. He's probably better than the guys I listed, but not nearly good enough to qualify for the next rung. Adams II may be ranked unreasonably high, but I strongly admire his post-presidency political career.

After that is the rung of actual good presidents. Presidents who actually had a good vision even if I don't always agree with that vision or their tactics. They actually accomplished good things while in office. I'm still critical of them, but I think they weigh in firmly on the positive side. This is filled with guys like Thomas Jefferson (I waffle on him), James Madison, Woodrow Wilson, Harry S Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Barack Obama.

The final and highest rung are those presidents who, in my eyes, qualify as Great Men of History (Politician Edition)^(TM). All joking aside, these are the greatest presidents in my mind. Even if they did some or many disagreeable things, I think the good things they did greatly overshadow them. In chronological order, these Great Presidents^(TM) would be George Washington (borderline), Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt (may be a bit overrated, but he's easily my favorite President), and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (I consider FDR to be the best President).

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for Joe Biden, I think he's done a lot of good stuff in his first year-and-a-half in office given the political constraints he faces. Domestic policy highlights for me include the stimulus checks, the American Rescue Plan and the vaccine rollout, changes he made to the USPS, forgiving some student loan debt (all in my case) and continuously delaying loan repayment, the infrastructure bill, the CHIPS Act, the PACT Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act.

Foreign policy highlights for me include withdrawing completely from Afghanistan, supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia, reengaging with the Iranians in regard to the nuclear deal, overseeing a massive drop in drone strikes in foreign conflict zones, and rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement.

Of course, there are many aspects of his presidency that I am critical of. However, I've found that those criticisms are mostly because I want him to do more of what he's already done rather than for him to just do something even microscopically good. It's like the difference between upgrading from one slice of pizza to two slices and not getting any pizza at all.

I think, for me, when honestly rating his presidency, it's important to get over the fact that Biden isn't Bernie. If you're waiting for Biden to, for example, cancel all student loan debt then I think you're purposefully setting yourself up for failure, disappointment, and maybe even anger. I can understand wanting it, but I also think it was ridiculous to even put that card in your deck of potential new policies and laws. A lot of stuff like that is likely never going to happen. Especially with how Congress looks right now and with what kind of politician Biden is.

As far as ranking him, I think, with what he's done so far, Biden is already equal to or slightly better than Obama and that those two have been the best presidents since Lyndon Johnson and Harry Truman. Hopefully, he keeps the train going.",0.9969,5

Mixed economies are a result of capitalists of the past being forced to compromise with socialists. Socialism is why we don't have the *really* bad capitalism anymore.

Like, 100% socialism isn't the only socialism. In fact, almost no socialism is like that, even in countries that claim to be socialist.

Socialism is like democracy. Nowhere on Earth has 100% infinity democracy. But most places on Earth have some democracy, and almost everywhere democracy is, it improves things over not having democracy, and most places where there could be more democracy, it would make things better so long as it's implemented well. The result is that democracy is one of very, *very* few things that have improved the quality of life of humanity without being a physical technology.

Socialism by ending the *really* bad capitalism, has already proven itself to be at that tier of value to civilization. But capitalism, hate to tell you - still pretty bad!

Presently, capitalism is on track to burn down the planet and exterminate the human species via extreme climate change brought about by the actions of rich people who will be dead before then, and so do not care.

Capitalism can *not* stop doing that, because *capitalism is what is doing that*, because capitalism is why those rich people have the power to make those decisions. Right now, we need to stop the still-bad capitalism, and that will take *way* more socialism implemented in *way* more places, until rich people no longer have the power to choose to burn down the planet and exterminate humanity to make their line go up.",0.7841,36

Personally, I feel Canada needs to prepare for the resources of tommorow, not the demands of today. While I support private investments in Oil and Gas, Russia has in fact accelerated the global shift away from oil, and countries will move away from it in the next decades. The Government
should not spend money on oil and gas, and should not destroy ecosystems for it.


We should focus on
- Natural Gas
- Lithium
- Rare Earth Metals
- Core resources (metal/iron/nickel)
- Hydrogen
- Lumber

And instead of just exporting, we need to utilize advancements in robotics and automation to manufacture and process these materials at a cheap price, replacing China. 

Canada is in a really strong position as a democratic state with good freedoms and little risk from climate change. 

The combination of basically unlimited resources in this country, a strong manufacturing industry that can grow even larger, a growing IT sector, increasing investments by our government, and strong allies in Europe and North America make us posed for high growth.

&gt;That means, for instance, that Norwegian runways, Seattle streets and London bridges handle wind, rain and cold just fine, but a triple-digit heat wave? Not so much.
&gt;
&gt;This project illustrates some of what can happen when unprecedented heat settles over a built environment that isn’t ready for it. Each of these things has happened somewhere, or in many places, around the world, but we’re putting them all in one fictitious town.

&gt;Our fictional friends in Meltsville had just one weather crisis to handle, with no water shortage, no wildfires, no storms.

The difference is that in the past machines replaced human physical labour and pushed humans to leverage their mental intelligence to justify their labour value instead. Now artificial intelligence replaces human mental intelligence. What do humans have to leverage next?

The main point is that artificial intelligence is a fundamentally unique type of automation.

But often people fall into the fallacy of believing that ""human society always eventually advances in a positive direction"" is an unfallable law of nature based on an insignificant 100k year record which biases them towards over-valuing historical trends and prevents them from correctly appraising new things.

Similar reason for why people have difficulty recognizing how human intervention can drive climate change and mass extinction of millions of species. It is difficult to recognize how advancement enables human actions to negatively impact the environment on a planetary scale.

If we suddenly discovered that covid vaccines were unsafe (which they aren't), it's not like everyone would lose their jobs - in fact they'd have more work to do, and would receive even more funding to develop a vaccine that is safe. If they found that covid vaccines are perfectly safe (which they are), then there would still be more work to do developing future vaccines to be more effective, especially against newer variants.

Essentially, the likelihood of a donation influencing the results of scientific research, and not having that be found out pretty quickly is exceptionally low.

It'll definitely have to wait until my kid is out of the house (a few years yet), but I could be down for this then.

But the truth is: What can we do? Even if we were to stop all carbon emissions tomorrow, we're still screwed. Thwaites is about to uncork a bunch of ice. The permafrost is thawing, releasing tons of methane. The disappearing ice is going to leave darker surfaces to absorb more heat. Which is to say, we're entering a massive positive feedback cycle that will be technologically, beyond our abilities to stop. At this point, I don't think we can feasibly stop it from happening. The genie is out of the bottle.  We'll have to ride it out until all those positive feedback sources run out of fuel. That'll be several decades at least. The methane will break down in 8 years or so, but it breaks down into CO2 and H2O, so that's not fantastic either.

I dunno man, I think our goose is cooked. And honestly, if climate change doesn't do it, how long until a virologist, spurned by their lover, decides to manufacture a bunch of novel, contagious, and deadly viruses and release them on the public?  The genomes of thousands of viruses are publicly available online. The equipment to do it could be purchased for less than the cost of a house and really, having worked in university labs, old equipment can end up in storage and people forget about it.

**Finances:** talk about them and agree to a plan. Joint account or no joint account? 50-50 or slightly different percentages, depending on who is making more at the time? Keep in mind that at different points in the relationship, the financial balance will shift. You may earn more for a time and then your SO might earn more for a time. The real important thing here is that you and your SO are able to adapt to the changes together (this is not just for finances, but for the marriage as a whole and your lives together).

**Division of Household Labor:** self-explanatory.

**Family Expectations:** Of course, this is about whether you want kids or not and also HOW to raise them. But this is also about managing your individual families. Got a toxic family member on your side? It's your responsibility to put them in their place, put up boundaries, defend your spouse. Got a toxic in-law? Your SO better be doing the same things.

**Life/Career Goals:** Obviously, be supportive and be honest. You're going to talk to each other about this stuff and goals will sometimes change as circumstances change. And you are going to have your individual goals, mostly for career. Create a relationship and marriage where you both feel like you have the freedom to pursue your individual goals too, not just the shared ones.

**Friendships:** Similar to Life/Career Goals. You will have shared mutual friends and then your individual friends. Once again, make sure there's a balance. Yes the majority of your time will be spent together. But for a truly healthy relationship and marriage, you need to create time and space to allow yourselves to grow as individuals. This means spending time with your friends, sometimes without your SO. So long as there's nothing shady and you trust each other, there isn't nothing to worry about. If you're unsure about a specific friend because of something communicate with your SO about your feelings.

**Therapy/Marriage Counseling:** Be open to these things IF things ever get really bad in the marriage. Let your SO know before marriage that you are open to these options and ask if they are too. We cannot predict the future. Relationships and marriages go sour for all kinds of reasons and it can happen to anyone. If your SO knows that you are at least open to therapy and marriage counseling as a last resort if things ever get THAT bad, then it really establishes a certain level of trust.

**Health/Food/Exercise:** Make sure you both take your health seriously, physical and mental. You obviously care about each other, but your individual health is your responsibility. How you guys do it is really up to you. If you like exercising together, that's fine. If it's better for you guys to exercise individually, that's fine too. Just as long as you both are taking care of yourself. For mental health, seek therapy when possible.

**Social Issues and Politics:** While it may seem self explanatory, a lot of people don't always know where their partners stand on hot button issues. If you two had a kid that came out as gay or trans or anywhere else on the LGBT2SQ+ spectrum, how would that be handled? How do you two want to discuss things like systemic racism? How do you both feel about the climate crisis? etc.

**End of Life and Medical Decisions:** This probably feels like a very far off thing but understanding each other's needs and wants when it comes to quality of life is important. You two will have medical power of attorney over the other and knowing what your partner wants and does not want is critical.

**Now you might be thinking: ""Coastal, these are huge topics, we're just moving in together"" and you're right but all too often people progress relationships to moving in without thinking about some of the bigger picture things. It's better to discuss this stuff now when you're in an international LDR rather than when you're local and in a tricky situation.**

Otherwise, my standard copy and paste advice is as follows:

Whether you’ve lived with a partner before or not, there’s lots of important questions to ask when you’re closing the distance and having someone move to you, or moving to them. 

Here are a few things to consider when you’re broaching the subject 

T**he Biggest One:** 

Who is moving, what does the visa/moving process look like, and what financials do you need to make this work.

Let’s be real, logistics aren’t sexy, but they’re what will make this dream come true. It’s important to ask these questions to work through who it makes the most sense to move. 

**Some Other Logistical Questions:**

* Timeline: what is a realistic timeline to make this happen, what obligations need to be met prior to closing the distance

* Living situation: are you moving in together or living separate for a while? Are you finding a new apartment all together or staying in your SO's old place? 

* Finances: how do you plan to split bills, cost of the visas or moving costs etc. Is this a financially viable time to move?

After you’ve explored the facts, it’s time to have some tough conversations about what could happen during the process of closing the distance and after. Consider having some of these bigger picture conversations. 

* What happens if your significant other is failing to thrive in their new ""home""? (Can't find a job, struggling to make friends, is generally homesick and miserable, etc.) It’s not something anyone really wants to think about but it is a reality. It’s wise to contemplate what you would do before you get down the rabbit hole and realize that you’re stuck. 

* What is your vague relationship timeline/goals? Do you want kids in the next year or two? A house? Make sure you're on the same page with what should be joined goals.

* Are you both willing to make some sacrifices? If it's better for your SO to live in a big city rather than your hometown due to career or schooling opportunities, are you willing to try moving there? Sometimes closing the distance doesn’t always mean exactly where you or they currently are, moving to a third city is sometimes the most beneficial and rarely something couples contemplate.

* What are your realistic expectations for living together? When you’re visiting your SO, you’re likely not experiencing their real every day life and you won't be in vacation mode, so what does a normal M-F look like to the two of you? And do your individual lifestyles compliment or clash with each other?",0.9991,8

Advice to ""just ride slowly"" does absolutely nothing lol since in this climate we start sweating immediately after stepping outside the house. This will be slightly harder if you're an undergrad and thus don't have dedicated office space like I did to store stuff, but here were the crucial things for me that made bike commutes tolerable during the hell period of May to late November:

* **Bring a change of underwear** \-- this is relatively easy since it's small and you can just stuff it into your backpack. (You specified F, so I'd recommend commuting in a sports bra if that's your thing and also changing that once you arrive.) Most days I didn't bring a whole change of clothes, not even a new shirt. It's amazing how far simply dry underwear will go to making you much more comfortable throughout the day.
* **Quick sink bath** \-- as soon as you arrive on campus and lock up your bike, find a good restroom where you can run your wrists under the cold tap for a minute (this really helps you stop sweating faster, unless the ""cold"" tap is lukewarm in the summer like in LA, which is super annoying), and then get some damp paper towels and wipe down your sweatiest parts before changing clothes (see previous point). The key here is to try to start the cooling down/stop sweating process asap because otherwise sponging off with paper towels won't do any good.
* **Bring deodorant** \-- since you don't have an office, just keep a travel deodorant in your backpack.
* Stay in a building with good A/C for a while, until you thoroughly cool down. YMMV depending on your class schedule, of course. In grad school there was a coffee shop on the edge of campus that I'd go to early in the morning to work for a while, then ride/walk my bike to the office later.",0.9778,11

In reality it would look nothing like that at all and would probably be something more like the Syrian conflict. Which is a terrible thought, but it would be chaotic and involve various groups utilizing guerrilla tactics and supported by certain international actors who desire to see instability in the US. Hopefully that never happens. 

Regardless, to narrow down my point, it’s no secret that police and the military are largely made up of conservative minded people.

Year by year you can have pretty drastic differences, but it's the long-term trend you have to look at. But 100 years from now, I don't think you're going to find many humans on this planet, if you find any... We're very rapidly approaching a point where a virologist with the motivation and modest means can produce a handful of deadly, contagious viruses and wipe out most of mankind. This isn't crazy talk. You can order DNA on the internet. You can buy the equipment to manufacture viruses for less than the cost of a house. We have complete genomes (publicly available info) for thousands of viruses.

Some might ask, ""why would someone do that?"" I'd say, ""Ask Stephen Paddock, Jim Jones, David Koresh, and Jin Ruchao, among others."" You can't tell me Stephen Paddock wouldn't have wiped out mankind given the opportunity. So it's not a matter of IF it will happen. It's simply a matter of when a virologist gets angry enough.

And if by some chance that just doesn't happen (maybe civilization collapses first), then we're screwed in a number of other ways. Every day there are stories about how climate change is worse than they originally predicted. Today from Scientific American, ""This Hot Summer Is One of the Coolest of the Rest of Our Lives"" An article on CBS today about lakes in the Arctic disappearing, ""Scientists long expected that Arctic lakes would expand with climate change as ground ice continued to melt and climate models showed that drying would not be seen until at least 2060 or 2150."" Oops, guess they botched that prediction pretty badly. All the glaciers are disappearing way faster than they ever predicted. Nobody predicted the massive methane emissions from thawing permafrost, and thawing permafrost wasn't anything we were expecting to see in the 2000s, if you asked 20 years ago.

A lot of people find this really depressing. I mean, I've done a good bit of research in this and I don't really see a silver lining. Our best case scenario is that there will be a massive loss of life and maybe some people will survive long-term, but I think it's unlikely. I'm way past the emotional side of this. Until someone can show me something super-promising, I see this as more or less, a fact waiting to happen.

Did I mention the plummeting fertility rates for men? Between 1930 and 1992, sperm counts in men in America dropped about 50%. They continue to fall and those rates are now dropping worldwide. Within a few decades, most men will be effectively infertile. So you tag that on to all the other stuff going wrong and it's going to be hard to survive.",0.4383,1

If collectively most of the world's carbon was from of solar and hydro construction, we'd be in a much much different world.  
  
Not every place is fortunate to have vast hydro resources like Canada and especially Quebec.  With climate change and droughts, and water rights being huge contentious points, hydro dams looking less feasible in many parts of the world.  
  
The research is showing that solar panels re-coup their carbon emissions within months to 3 years.  As the world wide grid becomes more carbon free, so too will the manufacture of solar panels.  Solar panels (and renewables in general) solve their own carbon emissions problem.  Also, with the ample rooftop and parking lot area of a typical solar factory, wouldn't they start installing solar panels onto their own roofs?  Their CO₂ emissions would go down significantly by using the very product the factory makes!  
  
25 years is only the warranty period of most solar panels and 25 years is a long time indeed.  Even then, the panels will still have some 80% of their original power capacity available.  

Solar farms are the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of all energy sources with wind a close second depending on its on- or off-shore wind.

Solar farms may actually never die either.  They can ""rejuvenate"" themselves by incrementally and partially replacing old panels with newer generation panels even as the farm is still running.   Other power plants like hydro, coal, gas, nuclear need near complete or total dismantle &amp; rebuild.  Both processes require skilled workers and machinery.  Solar farms can be built mostly by most any able-bodied person off the streets with minimal training and gear.  Everything is on the ground too.

Older aged solar panels can be donated or sold to less demanding applications.  Consider 80% capacity remaining on a **free** or much reduced-cost panel is better than 0% which you'd get with no panels.  Solar panels are incredibly robust being sealed solid-state semiconductor components.  They may never actually reach 0% functionality.

The video was relating to rooftop solar.  It needs to be said that only solar is able to so seamlessly blend into the urban landscape.  Solar operates completely silently with no moving parts.  Solar panels provide the most efficient use of energy as every watt generated locally is a watt not stressing a distant power plant or the grid to transmit that watt.  Only solar does this.  Residential and commercial solar actually ""unloads"" the grid.    
  
Persistent strong heat waves are making the news these days all over the world.  It needs to also be said that solar works extremely well in heat waves as heatwaves come with abundant sunshine.  The local energy grid experiences some of it's maximum stress levels during heatwaves and residential &amp; commercial solar helps unload the grid at this critical time.

Pervasive residential/commercial solar also helps build a more *distributed* grid architecture versus the traditional monolithic *centralized* grid architecture.  Distributed systems are far more resilient than centralized ones.  Distributed systems are tough to take down completely.",0.9852,1

Well thought out response and good info to know.  I prefer deep diving on the subtleties of something rather than just blindly accepting the entirety of an ideology. At the very least i want to look at this issue as something more than EV GOOD, ICE BAD. 

&gt;but I would argue that climate change is the most immediate threat to the environment, and because of that and the difficulty of quantitatively comparing the impact of different chemicals, it makes sense to treat greenhouse gas emissions as the primary variable to minimize.

My only response to this, is that if that is the case, then the first thing that should be on the agenda for environmentalist types is becoming Vegan. I'm not a Vegan myself, but it's clear that the carbon footprint of factory farming is not sustainable. It goes far beyond what passenger ICE cars ever did. We cannot provide meat for everyone in the world to have every single day. It is not good for the planet. You don't just get to buy a flashy new 80,000$ EV and show off your cool car and then stop there. If these people truly want to ""minimize carbon footprint"" eating meat should be the first step before the car you drive. That is if we are going in the order of priority of what's most detrimental like you mentioned. In my eyes, a vegan in an ice car is more environmentally conscious than some rich dude who bought a tesla. 

The only way to get the world to stop eating meat or reduce meat consumption is to legislate it, so long as it's legal and people want it, they will do what it takes to get it.  and good luck changing that. They're trying with fake artificial meat, but i predict that to be a failure that needs more years of research and technology before it ever takes off. Some sources cite animal agriculture responsible for over 80% of global greenhouse gasses. That' IN SANE. that HAS to be exaggerated. If that's the case you see why i'm not as concerned over an ICE car versus eating meat.",0.9431,1

Even a few degrees difference can have massive effects on the planet and it’s inhabitants.

The fact that different parts of the world are getting record lows and record highs in daily temperatures is one of those effects. It’s why they stopped calling it global warming… because a level of ignorance of the scope of what a warming planet entails was confusing people when they were getting record lows. Climate change, while not as detail related but still accurate to describe the issue, was easier for people to understand in name. 

Global warming/climate change is 100% a real thing. Denial of that is pretty stupid at this point, and I believe the government’s foux salutations have only exacerbated the issue of acceptance from people. It’s important to recognize that global climate change is a natural thing too, but unfortunately humans are vastly impacting the rate at which this thing is happening. And make no mistake, it is a dangerous problem. We could essentially create a planet that is no longer habitable to us, or on a smaller and sooner scale, change earth to a world that is not at all livable in the way we’re used to. 

You can be AnCap, or capitalist, or libertarian, or even Republican and still acknowledge the existence and severity of this issue, without agreeing with how the liberals or the government want to solve this issue.

We probably won't even need to continue to pave over our desert lands with solar panels and turbines in order to satiate a demand of almost 50,000 MW during the summer. By the way, California's peak power demand was in July 2006. Our consumption has yet to reach the same level of demand in over 16 years. Even with the proliferation of EVs, self-generating homes will probably offset a lot of what we would otherwise see as demand, at least for the next few years.

Diablo Canyon supplies us with 2,256MW (+/- 10MW) of power every day, and has done so without issues for decades. Right now, DC is running at 100% of its nameplate capacity, and has been running between 99.8 and 100.3% of its rating all day, and will do so again tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after tomorrow. Nuclear power is clean, consistent, and cheap (fuel costs in 2014 were 6 cents a KWh). If you care about the environment, you would support keeping it online.

&gt;California’s planet-warming emissions rose by 2% after the San Onofre generating station in San Diego County malfunctioned, eventually leading to its permanent closure. That wasn’t the only reason emissions rose, but it was almost certainly a factor.  
&gt;  
&gt;Similarly, the share of New York state’s electricity coming from natural gas, a fossil fuel, rose by 4 percentage points after one of two reactors at the Indian Point nuclear plant closed last year. The other reactor produced its final electrons last month.  
&gt;  
&gt;It doesn’t have to be that way, and Diablo Canyon was supposed to be a model of how to retire a nuclear plant without worsening the climate crisis. But critics say Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Public Utilities Commission is failing in that mission.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Diablo’s retirement is going to increase greenhouse gas emissions. And their planning is not doing anything to prevent that,” said Mark Specht, an energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “We should have figured this out by now.”

Does a growing silence about climate on the right open up more opportunities like that, do you think?

&gt;Absolutely not. There isn’t a single Republican in my state who has lifted a finger on climate change. And until the Republican Party starts to develop a positive effort, the only solution is for them to stay out of public life — to remain in private life, where they can’t do any harm.

&gt;It doesn’t matter what sort of bland statements that they issue saying, “Oh yeah, I know climate’s a problem.” It’s how they vote. There are no votes, zero votes. There’s no votes in the Senate for climate action from the Republican Party. Zero. So they need to remain in private life. We need to do everything we can to ensure that until they change their stripes, and there’s no sign of that at the moment.

&gt;I hate to say that. It’s painful to say that because here you have this national catastrophe and you only have one party working. Until that changes, we need to elect Democrats. It’s the only game in town.

This, right here.

Personal transportation is responsible for a very small part of global carbon emissions and environment impact in general, and 2. An actual comparison of the environmental impact of ICEs and EVs is difficult to quantify. 

I'll address point 2 only. Yes, you are absolutely right that it is difficult! Lithium/cobalt waste is not the same as carbon dioxide emissions is not the same as NOx is not the same as diesel particulate. There are thousands of different chemicals that affect the environment in different ways. The EPA uses ""CO2 Equivalent"" emissions to compare energy use and chemicals that act as greenhouse gases relative to how much a certain amount of energy or a certain mass of a chemical affects the earth's mean temperature. You can find the EPA's calculator here: https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator

I don't know the science behind this CO2 equivalent calculation, but when we talk about comparing lifetime emissions of ICEs and EVs (a comparison which most apples-to-apples studies agree EVs win, but the amount by which they win varies widely), this is the metric that is usually used. Things like lithium waste from batteries and iron waste from engine blocks are not addressed by the calculator since they are not greenhouse gases. Similarly with non-fuel fluids like oil and coolant. All this is to say that I understand and agree that all of these chemicals have an important impact on the environment, but I would argue that climate change is the most immediate threat to the environment, and because of that and the difficulty of quantitatively comparing the impact of different chemicals, it makes sense to treat greenhouse gas  emissions as the primary variable to minimize. That's why we talk about carbon taxes, carbon emissions, etc. in any conversation about environmental preservation. I will also say that for all the chemicals I mentioned--lithium, iron/steel, and some consumable fluids used in an ICE--there are ways to recycle them to minimize buildup in the environment.

In summary, yes, it is hugely difficult to accurately quantify ""total environmental impact"" and as far as I know no such metric has been developed yet. However, ""CO2 equivalent emissions"" is a well-thought-out alternative metric, and is currently the best option we have for any ""environmental friendliness"" metric used in any comparison at all.",0.968,3

Anyone who's dependent on gas to heat or produce warm water is fairly fucked. These often are people who were unable to renovate to make their homes more efficient or people who rent. So financial lower- to lower middle class.
Or (and here it gets a bit interesting) people who did indeed recently renovate and used the (illogical) government support to rip out their old oil heating and convert to gas.They often were financially strained already from the high costs of renovations and are now pretty fucked, although I must admit I don't have that much compassion for them as it was basically known to everybody that this is a short sighted idea in terms of climate change alone.(TBF everyone I know who did so is a climate change denier and ""green-hater"" and did it at least a bit to ""rub it in Greta's face""..).
But in the end private households will be supplied at least in a reasonable manner (unless we something drastic like sabotage on infrastructure,etc.),but for a lot of people it might be too expensive -unless the government for once keeps the promise made today for a huge ""social energy net"" for lower incomes.

The other side is electrical power.And that is just a collective fraud on the market by the way our electricity wholesale prices work. 
Basically the most expensive mode of production dictates the prices - once meant to give renewables an advantage over conventional production it has long turned around and supported conventional production - now gas. 
We only produce something like 10-12% of our power demands with gas and this is normally more meant as a reserve capacity but due to the Frenchies having the real energy crisis (almost half of their nuclear powerplants are off the grid due to age, not enough cooling water or maintenance - and France is creating most it's energy supply with them,including heat) these plants are currently used 24/7. 
Which in turn created an enormous power bill for a lot of people and enormous profits for some energy companies.

The Housing crisis is one of the most pressing issues we are facing and there’s no question that it has an impact on climate change. sensitive to policies that are promoting more cars powered by fossil fuels to enter our communities.  I would certainly be supportive of introducing this type of policy to the conversation around Housing Production, Climate Justice, and transit-oriented development. Our state leaders are making this big push for transit-oriented development and reducing our reliance on vehicles that emit fossil fuels.   
  
In order to accomplish this vision, I do think that means we need to leverage the federal infrastructure dollars to ensure that we have the highest standards of road safety, bike lanes, and a modern public transit system that is safe + reliable so that new developments with reduced or eliminated parking can be a viable strategy for helping to reduce emissions.",0.9731,3

We have seen the legislature appropriately respond when it comes to things like reproductive health, gun control, early education investment, and public transit. There are a couple of areas I would point to as deficiencies.   


Civic &amp; Voting. This year the legislature should be applauded for modernizing our elections by making mail-in voting permanent and expanding early voting. However, they missed an opportunity to increase participation in our democracy by not joining nearly 20 other states + Washington DC including same-day voter registration into the legislation. Same-day voter registration is a viable strategy for increasing participation in our elections, especially amongst BIPOC communities and younger voters. 

  
Educator Workforce. I lead the educator diversity coalition in my day job as the advocacy director at Latinos for Education.. We filed landmark legislation this year to help us diversify the educator workforce and help address the teacher shortages in the profession. While the legislator made some great budgetary investments that our coalition pushed for ($25 million for scholarships + education debt payment &amp; programs to recruit/retain educators), they missed an incredible opportunity to provide more statewide support to districts by passing our bill. This legislation would have provided increased flexibility on licensure, more uniformity around diversification +retention+ hiring + training, additional funding for growing your own pipelines and gave educators a seat at the decision-making table to help solve workforce challenges moving forward. We are now seeing across our Commonwealth that many communities, including Salem, will be dealing with teacher and staffing shortages. This bill was too important not to make it to the finish line.   
  
For my part, here’s what I would do differently. First, I plan to integrate myself as a legislator into the types of statewide coalitions that I have led so that we can co-create solutions to the challenges we face across public education. Climate change, public transit, housing, and civic engagement. Second, I would have strongly opposed the approach of prioritizing sports betting over more pressing legislation that was held up like the Economic Development Bill, and the Educator Diversity Act.   
  
The legislature consistently runs out of time at the end of the formal session on 31st. I would like to see the body revisit the informal session altogether. In February of the 2nd year of the session, we run into joint rule 10 (the reporting deadline for bills) and then the legislature only gives itself 5 months to consider all the bills that get discharged favorably while navigating the budget and conference committees. My understanding is that this was a change that came about 30 years ago when members of a “Good government” group didn’t want lame ducks and folks who lost their races to pass legislation. While I understand this may have had its merits, it's very clear that too many good priorities are left on the table.",0.9907,5

I think we're dealing with tiers of insulation from climate change here, though the reasons why some places in the same general risk tier will be more livable will vary (ie the Great Lakes region has fresh water but has other issues). 

Also we need to look at geological and climatic regions, not state boundaries. The great lakes is a region; the parts of MI and MN that are far from them might as well be Ohio or Iowa climatically speaking. 

That said I think we know some areas that *are* going to be deeply difficult to persist in- the desert Southwest (water), the Southeast (flooding, hurricanes, and extreme heat/humidity wet bulb), and the non-great-lakes Midwest (drought, fires, heat, cold, tornadoes and extreme storms).

For me it was university and getting an education which helped realize just how ahistorical/wrong/cherry picked the claims of the right wing ""intelligentsia"" was. Like they would say shit about Islam or Muslims (which would more often than not be wrong or taken out of context) then not even mention things like colonialism, the CIA overthrowing half their governments or the little fact that America being a biiiig supporter of all the groups they claim to hate. I'm guessing that's one of the reasons they hate ""woke education in universities""/ 

They talk about how horrible feminism is but fail to mention the things it's actually done like give women, aka half the worlds population, more rights than ever which has allowed many societies to prosper. They want to actively go against that but also shit on countries like Saudi Arabia for preaching the same thing but praise Russia which is arguably way worse when it comes to the treatment of women. I kept asking myself why until I realized the obvious answer, it's a white country and everything they say is engrained with racist undertones meant to make who they deem as ""lesser"" or ""savages"" look as bad as possible based strictly on their skin color. 

Which is funny because for people who preach about ""Western civilization"" and ""Western values"", they sure do seem to hate both of those things and want to take back to a non-existent past. Like how far back do they want to go because a lot of what they preach goes against ""Western values"" even of the past and more I thought about it, the more I realized they would have to passed the enlightenment, passed Rome and even passed Greece to get to their ""perfect world"". 

And it really goes on and on, them denying climate change was also a big one, but I think the biggest thing was just how massive cry babies they all are and how they managed to convince people it's actually the left because of how well they stick together. Like all they do is whine and bitch and moan about cancel culture, the ""woke left"", cringe LGBTQ+ people/content online, Muslims, black people, Socialism etc. They don't actually have any platforms or ideas except being against what ever is actively moving people forward and cutting taxes on the rich, who just happens to fund them.

Indeed, the economic treatment of poorer countries by wealthier countries is bad, which is why we should promote actual policies that would actual make an impact in the real world, such as make better trade deals that don't allow child labor or dumping of wasting into the environment. Rather than.... whatever it is you people do. Also, it is still a deeply stupid claim that we can't improve life for people at home because some idiot online spread the fake narrative that the world is a zero sum game and improve life one place is only possible by increasing misery somewhere else or that wealth can only be moved around. The wealth state actually isn't funded by ""super exploitation"", though international companies are often exploitative and we should demand change",-0.7975,4

The Earth can’t even handle the current population getting a decent standard of living RIGHT NOW. It would take [1.1 Earths to give the global population in 2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33133712 ) (about 7 billion people at the time, it’s over 8 billion now and counting) the same living standard as the average person in China in 2012, accounting for resource consumption, land use, carbon emissions, etc. According to the cofounder of the organization that provided the data for the graphic, this is a SIGNIFICANT UNDERESTIMATE since “there are aspects on which no good data exists that we don't include, so our demand on nature is larger” as he stated in the article.


For context, [the average Chinese person made just a bit over $5.50 a day when the infographic was made](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-in-poverty-relative-to-different-poverty-thresholds?country=~CHN ) AFTER adjusting for price differences between countries. That’s about $2000 per year.


***The Earth CANNOT handle a population of 7 billion people living a lifestyle where they make just over $2000/year, adjusted for price differences between countries.*** This standard of living is FAR below what any housed person in a developed country could endure, nevermind enjoy life in, no matter how hard you try to make it sustainable. There is no way to provide a pleasurable existence for the 8 billion people alive now, never mind the 10 billion or more projected to exist by 2100. It will only get worse as developing countries industrialize and consume more resources per capita as populations boom and resources (many of which are nonrenewable) dwindle, especially with climate change dramatically exacerbating things. The only moral solution is lower birth rates unless you want a global genocide, eternal poverty for most of the planet ([as is happening now](https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2018-10-17/world-bank-half-the-world-lives-on-less-than-550-a-day )), or mass famine.


Then there are the horrific effects of climate change and resulting flooding, resource depletion, natural disasters, wars, immigration crises, etc. [The climate crisis could displace 1.2 billion people by 2050](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/09/climate-crisis-could-displace-12bn-people-by-2050-report-warns ) and [its effects on the environment, water supply, and agriculture are already causing shortages](https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/here-s-the-latest-data-on-climate-and-food-and-it-s-not-good/ar-AAYSNv7?ocid=msedgntp&amp;cvid=75cc860818c4436bbe8b895074b9aa7a ) even though we aren’t even close to the expected temperature increase or reaching net-zero emission targets yet (if ever). The second article also states that “some experts predict the earth will run out of topsoil within six decades.” If you thought the right wing backlash to the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis or Mexican immigration to the US that gave a global resurgence of the far right was bad, you haven’t seen anything yet. Not to mention, political crises and wars like the Arab Spring and the rise of terrorist organizations were [exacerbated by rising food prices and water shortages caused by climate change](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-and-rising-food-prices-heightened-arab-spring/ ).


But let’s say this is wrong and the planet can handle 11 billion or more people. Even then, there are still only a finite amount of resources available. As a result, those resources will be diverted away from the people who are already alive to the newborns. Why should everyone else accept reductions in their own quality of life so other people can have children?",-0.9384,108

I remember how the global temperature was supposed to rise between 3º to 9º by 2025. I remember how most species were supposed to perish by 1995. I remember how the Great Barrier Reef was supposed to die.

So, we have a comment composed of assertions of unidentified types of fallacies without providing argumentation or support for these assertions. If we must use youtube skeptic bro language, this is itself an informal fallacy, called [proof by assertion fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_assertion)
Calling something you dont like a fallacy doesnt automatically make it so, you need to substantiate it.
Next we have several really overt strawmen of my position, so let me first clear those.

**Strawman 1;**

&gt;dictatorships and mass executions

I do not advocate dictatorships, nor do i advocate ""mass executions of government members"". I am not a bolshevik. You are gonna have to step up your game and argue against my actual position, if we want to have a genuine discussion.
Make sure to argument however, why we should sit and hardcore oppose action putside of electoralism, wasting now more than 40 years on a fantasy, when the systemic violence that goes on due to that inaction outweighs even the more visible revolutionary violence.
And just as a reminder, make sure to not strawman me so absurdly this time.

**Strawman 2;**

&gt;Theres not going to be a global socialist revolution in the next 10 years -&gt; strawmanning me as anti-reform

You are again arguing against a strawman. Even my comment above very clearly states i support reforms. I dont _only_ support (minor) reforms, as I also do not oppose revolution, but again, i definitely support reforms through electoralism.  So i just so happen to advocate additional action outside electoralism, especially building mutual aid community networks, the only safety mechanism able to withstand the shocks of climate change. That type of action is even extremely peaceful :).

The third paragraph is so hilariously absurd that i had to read it twice to make sure i wasnt missing a point there somewhere.

Given that you are for some reason mentioning lightbulbs, lets take them as an example. 
So tell me, where do these ""swedish lightbulbs"" (?? lol) actually come from. Who extracted the rare earth elements for the electronics portion of the bulb for example? Spoiler: not swedes, rather slave kids in third world nations. And, where do these electronics go (dangerous waste) once used up? is it perhaps sent to Southeast asia to be picked apart by, again, slaves, wearing no protection and being chronically poisoned?

No, we don't. When we are talking about ""the rise in carbon levels,"" we're not talking about soot dust blowing in the air. We're talking about **carbon dioxide**. That's usually between .04 and .05 percent of the atmosphere. As in 4 parts per ten thousand.

Water vapor is the most abundant and most active greenhouse gas. The level of water vapor varies. 20% humidity is about 400 times as much as the average CO2 readings, and humidity is not a global constant.

We can replicate all of water vapor's known effects in the laboratory. But when it comes to the ""carbon cascade effect"" where just a little more C02 radically changes the behavior of the atmosphere, it's never been shown or replicated in the lab. **It's a computer projection,** a massive fudge factor that can't be accounted for in nature.

Speaking of 50 years, there have been at least two spans in that period when the climate change predictions have failed for years, **including right now.**

There isn't a single ""expert"" out there who can actually tell you how to lower global temperature. And as Sri Lanka has demonstrated, the accepted ""solutions"" will drive people into poverty and starvation.

Which is worse? Civil war or abject tyranny at the hands of an authoritarian government? When Trump was President people defended the political violence of the BLM riots because that was righteous struggle against an evil oppressor. Are Democrats incapable of oppressing those they see as a threat to them?

&gt;Will it be external? No, we have nuclear weapons.

That's a little naive. Our enemies can whittle away at our ability to influence the outside world without provoking a nuclear response. cyber attacks and economic warfare and invasion of our discourse with propaganda can't be repelled with nukes.

&gt;The real crisis scenarios are climate change economic collapse, and natural disasters.

The larger threat of economic collapse comes from people simply not wanting to work jobs to support the economy anymore. Climate change isn't causing that, unless you count the irrational fear of climate change causing millions of young people to become hopeless and nihilistic for no good fucking reason.

&gt;Ground-based combat in the United States will only be civil. I don’t want these militia guys taking point of a crisis. They immediately become the biggest threat to other civilians.

Maybe, but during the parade shooting in Dallas where 5 cops were gunned down by a BLM supporter. there was a group of about 50 of those militia guys armed with AR's, and yet there wasn't a single instance of friendly fire between the militia guys and the police because the militia guys followed all of the rules you are supposed to follow during an active shooter scenario.

So where are all of these people accidentally shooting each other's faces off? I'm sure you can point to a few idiots out there, but it seems to me like you're advancing a stereotype to justify your general disdain for everyone who holds a conservative opinion on 2A.

Yes, there were heroic acts and great ideas, but ultimately fealty to the dead and their ideas and their way of doing things is undeserved or worse.

What this means is that the future is unwritten.  We owe them nothing, as future generations should owe us nothing.  The future really begins when we stop forgiving the sins of the past, stop saying things like ""you have to understand the times,"" and judge harshly, so that we ourselves, and our descendants, do better: so that we do not expect charity from future generations and so get on with the business of fixing this misery, knowing we will, at least in terms of our legacy, be held accountable.

One of many examples is we have failed to constrain climate change.  We have, in the process of doing this, blamed everyone but ourselves (Americans, that is), the biggest carbon emitters in the world.  We complain limply, we blame industry, and then we buy what industry sells, keeping them afloat and yet we place exclusive blame on systems and institutions to absolve us from any responsibility to alter our own behavior.  We look for reasons to divide ourselves, to make coalition-building impossible. 

We focus on the [wake of the boat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oswx23Tz-_w) which only marks what happens in the past; the wake need not have anything to do with the future.  The wake points to the past.  And the ship can turn if people just want it to turn, and make the effort to start steering.

This atrocity is just one of countless examples of why we should stop trying to resuscitate the past.  It is not salvageable.  I wonder sometimes if people just lack the courage to face an uncertain future, wrench the boat in the new direction, and take the risk.

I'm sorry. It isn't my intention to be unkind.

But there's a balance between idealist/positive thinking and realistic thinking. 

By that, in this case, I mean that the reality of the situation is that these well out of control changes to the environment are a much, much bigger problem for humankind to work around than (for example) the industrial revolution and its effect on the average person, the average city, and the average nation way back around the turn of the *last* century. That challenge was a paper cut in comparison to the sword-through-the-belly that the challenge of surviving and adapting to climate change is and will be for the foreseeable future. 

Part of the problem (which the pandemic illustrated in no uncertain terms) is that the world being more connected was the main reason why supply lines crashed. The ways in which the wealthy investor class has changed our global economy in the interest of profit wound up being one of the things most affected by a pandemic. And nothing is being done to moderate that at all... and the next pandemic will almost certainly be worse. I'm not saying to expect it next year or even in your lifetime. But sooner or later, it will happen with some catastrophic results *unless some things about how commerce works are changed in a manner conscious of the simple fact that another pandemic will come*. 

That's just a tiny piece of it, but it is there. 

On the topic of disease: as localized weather becomes more extreme (as it is happening now), migrant patterns for animals are changing. This raises the likelihood of pathogens taking hold in places where they couldn't before. In the same package, there are seriously overpopulated places (Bangladesh is the ur-example) which exist in exactly the worst possible places to be as weather changes happen and the oceans begin to rise. This will result in multiple climate refugee crises across the civilized world. Right here in the states, the southwest will be a difficult place to live in relatively short order. And how many people live in or far too near to the mouth of the Mississippi? ""New Orleans is sinking"" isn't just a great song by The Tragically Hip. Right now, all over the world right around 40% of the global population lives within 100km of an ocean coast. A little more than 3 billion individuals. The ocean doesn't have rise much at all to render hundreds of coastal cities entirely unlivable. Some will just be under water. Miami has been having major issues with high-tide flooding for more than a decade now... and that's just the beginning. 

I'm just getting started and my reply is already in TL;DR territory. 

You're right: We WILL find new ways to get water. Right now desalinization technology is being refined and improved. That is very likely the best possible solution to the arising water needs. And crops are constantly being engineered for better survivability, faster growth, higher yields. There are limits to this, of course, but the bigger problem is in how our various cultures react to the knowledge that crops are being engineered. Right now an entirely bullshit ""organization"" gets paid to do nothing more than to *authorize* products as being non-GMO. There's tags from the Non-GMO Project on thousands of food items, and 99% of them have never been genetically modified (in a lab)... but Domino sugar still pays for, and passes along the cost to consumers, a tag so the consumer (who can't be bothered to do **actual** research) will feel ""safe"". People will have to be damn close to starvation before they'll finally eat golden rice for two reasons: the media makes its money on keeping people afraid and GMO's became boogeymen to do exactly that, and various and sundry celebrities and politicians with little-to-no critical thinking skills keep speaking loudly on the topic. 

Its alright to place your bets in line with history... the track record is there. But this isn't like any challenge we as a species have met before... it is much larger by far, and too many people are so bound up in ideology to even consider making changes to help.",-0.8048,2

So this issue with crops failing is starting to happen *everywhere*. What happens when every country has massive crop failures in the next few years?

Climate change isn’t ”everywhere getting hotter”, just at this time it is getting hotter on average. Some places will get cooler than average, while other get hotter on average. Some places will receive more rain then they would historically get while others will get less. there will be more extreme will get even more extreme on average.   


In terms of earths history this isn’t going to be abnormal. To to inconstant orbital patterns and tilt the seasonal patterns and temperature change in different areas. As land masses move, ice cover changes, and ocean current change, so does the way heat radiates across the earth and rains distribute.  There are many more factors involved. The one that is changing dangerously fast right now is atmospheric composition with green house gases slowing the radiation of heat and creating positive feed back loop as we loas our most reflective surface(ice) and gain more of the earths least reflective surface(water). Another big deal is the loss of permafrost mostly in canada, greens land, and Russia which releases methane which further increase green house gases, another positive feed back loop. So while changes in the past 100 years have been inconvenient, given current trends that are expected to get worse as a higher rate as time goes on things will get very dramatic very fast.   


While it’s noraml for earths climate to change it is not normal for human civilization to face climate change, we simply lack the ability to cope with the oncoming disasters. In 30-60 years 4-5 billion people will live, work, and depend on food in deltas. As ocean levels continue to rise these low lying deltas will be over come with sea water. This will result in the mass displacement of said billions, most likely to become homeless and jobless because at this rate we won’t have the infrastructure and housing adequate when it happens. The delta also make up a large portion of the farmland the world depends on which will result in mass starvation for many of those billions and anyone else that depended on the surplus of said deltas. The option could very well be to let them starve or accept mass food shortages for everyone, either way it won’t be pretty or peaceful. This is just the deltas, less predictable changes in seasonal patterns everywhere else will result in even worse production capabilities. It will be at this time people realize you can’t eat  money as there will be plenty of that and not enough resources. At the very least crime will skyrocket but it would be amazing if we didn’t suffer economic collapses for the record books.
